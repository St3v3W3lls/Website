        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<div class="div">
<p> We're GymBros. We exist to unite the conditioning* community. <br>

It's not our goals that unite us, but the things we do to achieve them. Because although our training grounds and end goals might be different, sweat is our sport. And we're a team of individuals who know that to go further, we go together. <br>

Our legacy began in 2012, from a garage in Birmingham, UK with nothing but a sewing machine, a screen-printer and ambitions we had no right to hold. Today, we create the tools that help everyone become their personal best: the clothing you'll sweat in, the content you'll find inspiration in and the community you'll become your best in. <br>

Our GymBros family of employees, athletes and followers is now over 10 thousand strong, with a total social media following of over 1.8 million and customers in over 230 countries across our 14 online stores. Our employee family is growing too, with over 900 employees across offices in five regions, including The Centeral Region,Eastern Region and Ashanti Region. <br>

*Conditioning is everything we do today to prepare for tomorrow.</p>
